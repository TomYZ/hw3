usage:
hw3 keygen -p=pphrase -t=period
hw3 crypt -k=keyfile [file] / stdin
hw3 invkey keyfile
hw3 histo -t=period -i=which [file] / stdin
hw3 solve -l=max_t [file] / stdin

clean: make clean

potential bugs: int solve.c, read all the length of the file, if the file is too large, may cause segment fault or overflow.
